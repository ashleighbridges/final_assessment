# Final Assessment

## Self Assessment:
In this project, I was the repository owner as well as the dashboard developer. I have career experience as a project manager, so I helped to set deadlines for each part of each item to make sure we were staying on track as well as reviewed the repository prior to each submission to ensure we were meeting all of the requirements. I also assisted other team members with finding solutions online to issues they would bring up during our meetings, as well as provided some of the visualizations used in the slide deck and repository.

Tableau was one of the most interesting parts of the course to me, so I also volunteered to create the dashboard in Tableau. This was the most difficult portion of the project for me because we covered Tableau at a higher level than what I was looking to use in the dashboard. To overcome this, I spent a lot of time on Tableau dashboards to figure out solutions to my problems. In the end, we were able to develop a dashboard we were all very pleased with!

## Team Assessment:
Overall, the team was very available and responsive via Slack at all times during the course of the project. We met every week on Sunday evening to touch base in between classes, as well as meeting the last week on Wednesday evening to put the final touches on the repository and practice our presentation.

Everyone on the team utilized their strengths to contribute to the project, which was helpful since along with their strengths, everyone also agreed we have our subjects in the course we feel weaker on. 

*Recommendations for Future Cohorts:*
- Make sure everyone in the team has the Slack app on their phone and their notifications turned on
- Meet at least once a week in addition to the class times and keep in touch in between with questions and updates on how your work is going
- Send a message to the Slack group when you submit a pull request so it can quickly be reviewed and approved
  - Whoever approves the pull request should confirm the merge as well
- Always double check that you are working in a branch (not main) and be sure to pull a fresh version of main to your branch before making any changes to your branch

## Project Summary:
This project addressed the global issue of credit card fraud. We tried a few different models and settled on a random forest machine learning model and trained it on an extremely large dataset (over 1 million records). The dataset was unbalanced, but we were able to get the model to accurately detect 76% of fraudulent transactions as fraud. The model also only falsely detected fraud in 30 out of 322,242 of valid transactions.
